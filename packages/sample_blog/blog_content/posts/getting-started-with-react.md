# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of React and create our first component.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."

## Key Concepts

### Components
Components are the building blocks of React applications. They're like JavaScript functions that accept inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

### JSX
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. It makes your code more readable and easier to write.

### State
State allows components to create and manage their own data. When state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect those changes.

## Creating Your First Component

Here's a simple example of a React component:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

This component accepts a `name` prop and displays a greeting message.

## Conclusion

React provides a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. Start with these basics and gradually explore more advanced concepts as you become comfortable with the fundamentals.
