# Next.js Best Practices for 2025

Next.js continues to evolve rapidly, and staying up-to-date with best practices is crucial for building performant, maintainable applications. Here are the key practices every developer should follow in 2025.

## App Router vs Pages Router

The App Router is now the recommended approach for new Next.js applications. It provides:

- Better performance with React Server Components
- Improved developer experience with co-located layouts
- More intuitive file-based routing

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization
Always use the `next/image` component for optimal image loading:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/hero-image.jpg"
  alt="Hero image"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  priority
/>
```

### Dynamic Imports
Use dynamic imports for code splitting:

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
});
```

## SEO Best Practices

### Metadata API
Use the new Metadata API for better SEO:

```jsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'My Page Title',
  description: 'Page description for SEO',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'My Page Title',
    description: 'Page description for SEO',
  },
};
```

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you build faster, more maintainable Next.js applications. Keep experimenting with new features and stay updated with the latest releases!
